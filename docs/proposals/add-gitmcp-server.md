# Proposal: Add GitMCP to Roo Code MCP Marketplace

## Overview

This proposal suggests adding GitMCP as a new MCP server to the Roo Code marketplace. GitMCP is a service that bridges AI assistants with GitHub repositories by serving repository content as structured context.

## GitMCP Details

**Name:** GitMCP  
**Description:** Bridge between AI assistants and public GitHub repositories. Simply change a repository's URL from github.com to gitmcp.io to serve the entire repository's content as structured context for AI models.  
**URL:** https://gitmcp.io/  
**Documentation:** https://gitmcp.io/docs

## Key Features

- **Dynamic, On-Demand Context**: Instantly provide Roo Code with the context of any public GitHub repository without manual setup
- **Reduces Hallucinations**: Grounds Roo Code in actual code and documentation of a repository
- **Improved Accuracy**: Provides accurate code completions and answers based on project's existing patterns
- **Universal Accessibility**: Single endpoint that can dynamically query any public GitHub repository
- **Ease of Use**: Seamless user experience - just ask about any public repository

## Proposed MCP Configuration

```yaml
- id: "gitmcp"
  name: "GitMCP"
  description: "Access any public GitHub repository as structured context. Transform github.com URLs to gitmcp.io for instant AI-ready repository content."
  author: "GitMCP Team"
  authorUrl: "https://gitmcp.io"
  url: "https://gitmcp.io"
  tags:
      - "github"
      - "repository"
      - "context"
      - "code"
  content: |
      {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "@gitmcp/server"
        ],
        "env": {
          "GITMCP_ENDPOINT": "https://gitmcp.io/docs"
        }
      }
  prerequisites:
      - "Node.js 18 or higher"
      - "npm or npx available in PATH"
```

## Alternative Configuration (Direct URL)

If GitMCP provides a direct MCP server endpoint:

```yaml
- id: "gitmcp"
  name: "GitMCP"
  description: "Access any public GitHub repository as structured context. Transform github.com URLs to gitmcp.io for instant AI-ready repository content."
  author: "GitMCP Team"
  authorUrl: "https://gitmcp.io"
  url: "https://gitmcp.io"
  tags:
      - "github"
      - "repository"
      - "context"
      - "code"
  content: |
      {
        "url": "https://gitmcp.io/mcp",
        "transport": "http"
      }
```

## Usage Examples

Once integrated, users could:

1. Ask: "Using GitMCP, show me how to use the useState hook in the facebook/react repository"
2. Request: "Analyze the architecture of the microsoft/vscode repository using GitMCP"
3. Query: "What testing patterns are used in the nodejs/node repository?"

## Benefits for Roo Code Users

1. **Instant Repository Context**: No need to clone or manually set up repositories
2. **Reduced Errors**: AI responses based on actual repository content
3. **Better Code Suggestions**: Aligned with project's existing patterns and conventions
4. **Learning Tool**: Easily explore and understand new codebases

## Implementation Notes

- The GitMCP server should be added to the remote marketplace configuration at `https://app.roocode.com/api/marketplace/mcps`
- Users would install it through the Roo Code marketplace UI
- The server would be available for both global and project-level installation

## Testing Considerations

Before adding to production:

1. Verify the MCP server endpoint is stable and responsive
2. Test with various public repositories
3. Ensure proper error handling for private/non-existent repositories
4. Validate rate limiting and performance

## Next Steps

This proposal should be submitted to the Roo Code team for review and potential inclusion in the marketplace API. The actual implementation would require updating the remote marketplace configuration managed by the Roo Code infrastructure team.

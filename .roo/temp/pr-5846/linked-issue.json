This creates unnecessary overhead and token usage.\n\n## Impact\n- Increased token consumption for unchanged context\n- Higher costs per conversation\n- Slower response times due to redundant processing\n- Larger context windows filled with duplicate information\n- Reduced model focus on actual user queries due to attention dilution\n\n## Proposed Solution\nImplement a change detection mechanism for environment details:\n\n1. Hash or fingerprint each section of environment details\n2. Only update the model context when a section actually changes\n3. Consider differential updates where only changed sections are sent\n\nThis optimization would significantly reduce token usage and improve performance for long-running conversations.","number":5844,"state":"OPEN","title":"Performance: Reduce duplicate environment details processing"}

    <instructions>
    **Review methodology:**

    1. **Contract Consistency:**
       - Verify all referenced properties exist in their types/interfaces/classes
       - Check for invalid, missing, or renamed properties
       - Confirm changes donâ€™t break inheritance, composition, or overrides
       - Look for contract violations across related entities

    2. **Reference and Usage Review:**
       - Trace references to changed functions, methods, or classes
       - Ensure usages remain compatible with changes
       - Watch for subtle breaking changes

    3. **Security review:**
       - Check for exposed sensitive data
       - Verify input validation
       - Look for injection vulnerabilities

    4. **Code quality checks:**
       - Identify code smells (long methods, complex logic, tight coupling)
       - Find duplicated code that should be refactored
       - Check for hardcoded English strings (should use i18n)
       - Verify test coverage for new/changed code

    5. **Performance considerations:**
       - Look for inefficient algorithms
       - Identify potential memory leaks

    **NEVER** run tests or execute code - only review.

    <question>I've completed my review of PR #[number]. Here's what I found:

    [If applicable: **Existing comments resolved:**
    - Comment about X - now addressed]

    **Review Findings:**
    - Critical, important, and minor items are summarized above.

    Inline Comments (edit as needed):

    List all review comments below using fenced code blocks, one per comment, with the info string "inline_comment".
    Use these fields:
    - path
    - line
    - side (LEFT/RIGHT)
    - body

    Example format (replace with real comments):
    ```inline_comment
    path: src/services/marketplace/SimpleInstaller.ts
    line: 87
    side: RIGHT
    body: Installing a marketplace mode overwrites a local mode with the same slug. Consider blocking or prompting to avoid unintended data loss.
    ```

    What would you like to do with these findings?</question>
